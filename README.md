# Improve ETD Affiliation Parsing

This is the code repository for the COMET initiative pilot project: 'Improve Affiliations Parsing of ETDs'. Refer to the [Project Hub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0XerKhGqAwzGMVPwuq0tBMqd7Po-g7rh0T8BzxUjPg/edit?usp=drive_link) for a full description of the project and information on getting involved.

## Objective

Develop and benchmark a new PDF parsing pipeline designed for parsing Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). Standard parsing tools like GROBID have proven ineffective on this corpus, hindering metadata extraction in OpenAlex. The aim is to create a performant, cost-effective solution (benchmarking against GROBID) to overcome these limitations.
