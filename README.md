# Improve ETD Affiliation Parsing

This is a COMET enrichment and curation workflow pilot project. Go to the [Pilot Projects Overview Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/14) to see all of the pilots.  

## Objective

Develop and benchmark a new PDF parsing pipeline designed for parsing Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). Standard parsing tools like GROBID have proven ineffective on this corpus, hindering metadata extraction in OpenAlex. The aim is to create a performant, cost-effective solution (benchmarking against GROBID) to overcome these limitations.

## Getting Involved 

COMET is in the process of setting up a Github space for ideas and feedback from the COMET community. In the meantime, get involved by: 
* providing input on the project at [the pilot project epic](https://github.com/cometadata/improve-etd-pdf-affiliation-parsing/issues/6)
* viewing the project's progress at the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/13)
* contributing topics about this pilot by opening an issue in this repo, or
* contacting COMET's Project Lead, Dione Mentis, at [dione.mentis@datacite.org](mailto:dione.mentis@datacite.org)
